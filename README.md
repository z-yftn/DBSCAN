# DBSCAN
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a popular clustering algorithm used for data analysis and pattern recognition. It groups data points based on their density, identifying clusters of high-density regions and classifying outliers as noise.
In this project, the DBSCAN algorithm has been applied to two datasets: Gaussian Mixture and Uniform Points. The sklearn library has been used for algorithm execution and dataset creation, along with matplotlib and numpy.
